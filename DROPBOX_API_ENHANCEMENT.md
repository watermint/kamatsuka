# Dropbox API OpenAPI Generator Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement extends the existing Kamatsuka tool to generate two additional OpenAPI specifications for Dropbox API, addressing the different use cases for individual users and team administrators.

## Background

Dropbox API has two main groups of endpoints:

1. **User Endpoints**: Designed for individual Dropbox accounts and team member operations
2. **Business Endpoints**: Designed for team admins of Dropbox for Teams

The user endpoints can be called in different contexts:
- From individual Dropbox accounts (standard user authentication)
- From team admin accounts with special headers (`Dropbox-API-Select-User` or `Dropbox-API-Select-Admin`)

## Implementation

### New CLI Commands

Added two new commands to the Kamatsuka tool:

#### `convert-individual`
Generates OpenAPI specification for individual Dropbox accounts.
```bash
cargo run -- convert-individual --stone stone/dropbox-api-spec --output dropbox-api-individual.yaml --verbose
```

#### `convert-team`
Generates OpenAPI specification for team admins.
```bash
cargo run -- convert-team --stone stone/dropbox-api-spec --output dropbox-api-team.yaml --verbose
```

### Generated Specifications

#### dropbox-api-individual.yaml
- **Title**: "Dropbox API - Individual"
- **Description**: Contains only user endpoints that can be called from individual Dropbox accounts without team admin headers
- **Endpoints**: User endpoints only (no team/business endpoints)
- **Headers**: Standard OAuth2 authentication only
- **Size**: ~377KB
- **Use Case**: Individual Dropbox users, personal applications

#### dropbox-api-team.yaml
- **Title**: "Dropbox API - Team"
- **Description**: Contains both user endpoints (with team admin headers) and business endpoints
- **Endpoints**: All endpoints (user + business)
- **Headers**: Includes `Dropbox-API-Select-User` and `Dropbox-API-Select-Admin` headers for user endpoints
- **Size**: ~1.2MB
- **Use Case**: Team administrators, business applications

### Technical Details

#### Team Admin Headers
The team specification includes two optional headers for user endpoints:

1. **Dropbox-API-Select-User**
   - Description: The team member ID to act on behalf of
   - Used by team admins to perform operations as a specific team member
   - Type: string
   - Example: `dbmid:AAHhy7WsR0x-u4ZCqiDl5Fz5zvuL3kmspwU`

2. **Dropbox-API-Select-Admin**
   - Description: The team admin ID to act as
   - Used by team admins to perform operations with admin privileges
   - Enables access to team-owned content
   - Type: string
   - Example: `dbmid:AAHhy7WsR0x-u4ZCqiDl5Fz5zvuL3kmspwU`

#### Endpoint Filtering
- **Individual spec**: Excludes all business endpoint namespaces (team, team_*, etc.)
- **Team spec**: Includes all endpoints with appropriate context descriptions

#### Business Endpoint Namespaces
The following namespaces are considered business endpoints and excluded from the individual specification:
- `team`
- `team_common`
- `team_devices`
- `team_folders`
- `team_groups`
- `team_legal_holds`
- `team_linked_apps`
- `team_log`
- `team_log_generated`
- `team_member_space_limits`
- `team_members`
- `team_namespaces`
- `team_policies`
- `team_reports`
- `team_secondary_mails`
- `team_sharing_allowlist`

### Code Structure

#### New Functions Added

1. **CLI Commands**:
   - `convert_individual_command()` - Handler for individual conversion
   - `convert_team_command()` - Handler for team conversion

2. **Conversion Functions**:
   - `convert_stone_to_openapi_individual()` - Entry point for individual conversion
   - `convert_stone_to_openapi_team()` - Entry point for team conversion
   - `convert_stone_directory_to_openapi_individual()` - Individual directory processing
   - `convert_stone_directory_to_openapi_team()` - Team directory processing

3. **OpenAPI Generation**:
   - `merge_namespaces_to_openapi_individual()` - Merges user endpoints only
   - `merge_namespaces_to_openapi_team()` - Merges all endpoints with team context
   - `create_openapi_operation()` - Helper to create operations with optional team headers

### Verification

The implementation was verified to ensure:
- ✅ Individual spec contains 0 team endpoints
- ✅ Team spec contains 97 team endpoints
- ✅ Individual spec contains 0 team admin headers
- ✅ Team spec contains team admin headers for user endpoints
- ✅ Both specs have appropriate titles and descriptions
- ✅ File sizes reflect the different content scope

## Usage Examples

### For Individual Developers
Use `dropbox-api-individual.yaml` when building applications for personal Dropbox accounts or when you only need user-level functionality.

### For Business Application Developers
Use `dropbox-api-team.yaml` when building applications that need to:
- Manage team members and permissions
- Access team-owned content
- Perform administrative operations
- Act on behalf of team members using select headers

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Separate specifications make it clear which endpoints are available for different use cases
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Individual developers don't see business endpoints they can't use
3. **Better Documentation**: Team admin headers are properly documented with examples
4. **Maintainability**: Automated generation from Stone specs ensures consistency

## Files Modified

- `src/main.rs` - Added new CLI commands and handlers
- `src/converter/mod.rs` - Added conversion functions and OpenAPI generation logic
- Generated output files:
  - `dropbox-api-individual.yaml` - For individual users
  - `dropbox-api-team.yaml` - For team admins

This enhancement provides a more targeted and user-friendly approach to Dropbox API integration for different user types while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Stone DSL specifications.

## Results

The enhancement successfully generated two distinct OpenAPI specifications with the following outcomes:

### dropbox-api-individual.yaml
