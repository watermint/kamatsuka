In this project, my goal is to model the Dropbox API in Alloy and determine whether arbitrary use cases are feasible.

For example, when a developer wants to know whether it is possible to add users to a team folder, they can use the Alloy model to investigate whether this is feasible.

## Dropbox API specification

In the folder `stone/dropbox-api-spec/`, there is a set of API definition by using Dropbox's stone (https://github.com/dropbox/stone) DSL.

## OpenAPI 

Store OpenAPI version API definition under the folder `openapi/`
